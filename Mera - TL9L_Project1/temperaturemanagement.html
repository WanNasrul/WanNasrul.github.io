    <p>Laptops nowadays generate heat as natural byproduct of their operations, mainly due to its <strong>CPU</strong>. 
         This CPU is a crucial component of a computer of any digital device, and its primary function is to execute intructions and perform calculations for various tasks and programs.
         Some CPUS overheat due to the laptop running too many processes and applications that run simultaneously. 
         Laptops were selectively chosen for temperature testing and comparison to determine the best-performing one which is Macbook Air M2 and Lenovo LOQ.
         This comparison were made to deteremine which of these two amazing laptops perform amazingly without having any overheat issues.
    </p>
     
    <br><br><p>What is a CPU?</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>CPU stands for <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong>. 
            It refers to so called the <strong>brain</strong> of the computer or the <strong>processor</strong>.</li>
        <li>Does all the heat management and cooling solutions.</li>
        <li>Balancing the performance wtih power efficiency.</li>
        <li>Handles graphics-related tasks</li>

<!-- <p>Based on the data given, we can see that these two laptops are really powerfull at preventing overheat issues.
    Now we know that Macbook Air M2 temperature management is more optimised than the Lenovo LOQ </p> -->
    <br><br>
    <p>In summary, if your primary concern is temperature management during demanding tasks or gaming, the Lenovo LOQ is likely the better choice due to its gaming-oriented design
         and more substantial cooling system. However, if you prioritize portability and noiseless operation, the MacBook Air M2 might be a more suitable option for everyday tasks, as
         long as you don't push it to its thermal limits with resource-intensive workloads. Keep in mind that these are different categories of laptops designed for different use cases
        , so your choice should also consider your specific needs and preferences.</p>
