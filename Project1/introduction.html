                <p>After 14 years, three revisions, and two different processor architectures, 
                  the iconic wedge shape of the MacBook Air is now history. In its place is a 
                  MacBook Air with a completely new design that’s the same thickness from front to back. 
                  Virtually every aspect of the new MacBook Air has been updated or changed — 
                  it’s the biggest update to the Air since it originally debuted nearly a decade and a half ago.
